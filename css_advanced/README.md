# Smile School - HTML Structure Project

This project is a fully structured HTML page built as part of an HTML advanced exercise.  
It focuses on semantic HTML, clean layout organization, proper nesting of elements, and preparing the page for styling in a future CSS task.

The goal is to build a complete multi-section webpage following a given wireframe.  
No CSS or JavaScript functionality is implemented here — this file contains only the HTML structure.
